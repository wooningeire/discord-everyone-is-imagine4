# imagine4
Joke stylesheet that, when applied to Discord (back when this was created), used to give everyone's messages the same name and avatar as Imagine4. `imagine4unfair.css` additionally altered users' profile cards, roles, and more so that you could not check who someone really was. (A number of people were a bit too hasty to change their nicknames as a joke after seeing this and got warned. Oops.)

Likely will not work anymore due to class names containing mangling in later versions of Discord.
